<h2>School</h2>

<p> Cerritos College, in Norwalk, California, is where I am currently enrolled.
I am in my third year of college and am extremely close to graduating. My overall experience in Cerritos has been positive, and I have had few unfavorable experiences here. My teachers have been generally excellent, with a few deviations that could have been due to covid and online classes. </p>
